Scope

Modern cryptography is a vast area of study as a result of fast advances made in the past thirty
years. This book focuses on one aspect: introducing fit-for-application cryptographic schemes
 
and protocols with their strong security properties evidently established.
 
The book is organized into the following six parts:

Part I This part contains two chapters (12) and serves an elementary-level introduction
for the book and the areas of cryptography and information security. Chapter 1 begins with
a demonstration on the effectiveness of cryptography in solving a subtle communication
problem. A simple cryptographic protocol (first protocol of the book) for achieving "fair coin
tossing over telephone" will be presented and discussed. This chapter then carries on to
conduct a cultural and "trade" introduction to the areas of study. Chapter 2 uses a series of

simple authentication protocols to manifest an unfortunate fact in the areas: pitfalls are
everywhere.

(i.e., fit-for-application) security properties, oftenwith security evidence formally established.
The book also includes self-containedtheoretical background material that is the foundation for
modern cryptography.

This part can also be used to conduct a systematic background study of the theoretical
foundations for modern cryptography.

Part III This part contains four chapters (710) introducing the most basic cryptographic
algorithms and techniques for providing privacy and data integrity protections. Chapter 7 is
for symmetric encryption schemes, Chapter 8, asymmetric techniques. Chapter 9 considers
an important security quality possessed by the basic and popular asymmetric cryptographic
functions when they are used in an ideal world in which data are random. Finally, Chapter
10 covers data integrity techniques.

Since the schemes and techniques introduced here are the most basic ones, many of them
are in fact in the textbook crypto category and are consequently insecure. While the
schemes are introduced, abundant attacks on many schemes will be demonstrated with
warning remarks explicitly stated. For practitioners who do not plan to proceed with an in-
depth study of fit-for-application crypto and their strong security notions, this textbook
crypto part will still provide these readers with explicit early warning signals on the general
insecurity of textbook crypto.

Part IV This part contains three chapters (1113) introducing an important notion in
applied cryptography and information security: authentication. These chapters provide a
wide coverage of the topic. Chapter 11 includes technical background, principles, a series of
basic protocols and standards, common attacking tricks and prevention measures. Chapter
12 is a case study for four well-known authentication protocol systems for real world
applications. Chapter 13 introduces techniques which are particularly suitable for open

\x0csystems which cover up-to-date and novel techniques.

Practitioners, such as information security systems administration staff in an enterprise and
software/hardware developers whose products have security consequences may find this
part helpful.

Part V This part contains four chapters (1417) which provide formalism and rigorous
treatments for strong (i.e., fit-for-application) security notions for public-key cryptographic
techniques (encryption, signature and signcryption) and formal methodologies for the
analysis of authentication protocols. Chapter 14 introduces formal definitions of strong
security notions. The next two chapters are fit-for-application counterparts to textbook
crypto schemes introduced in Part III, with strong security properties formally established
(i.e., evidently reasoned). Finally, Chapter 17 introduces formal analysis methodologies
and techniques for the analysis of authentication protocols, which we have not been able to
deal with in Part IV.

Part VI This is the final part of the book. It contains two technical chapters (1819) and a
short final remark (Chapter 20). The main technical content of this part, Chapter 18,
introduces a class of cryptographic protocols called zero-knowledge protocols. These
protocols provide an important security service which is needed in various "fancy"

application scheme or protocol must also end at an analysis that the strong (i.e., fit-for-
application) security properties do hold as claimed. Consequently, some parts of this book
inevitably contain mathematical and logical reasonings, deductions and transformations in order
to manifest attacks and fixes.

While admittedly fit-for-application cryptography is not a topic for quick mastery or that can be
mastered via light reading, this book, nonetheless, is not one for in-depth research topics which
will only be of interest to specialist cryptographers. The things reported and explained in it are
well-known and quite elementary to cryptographers. The author believes that they can also be
comprehended by non-specialists if the introduction to the subject is provided with plenty of
explanations and examples and is supported by self-contained mathematical background and
reference material.

The book is aimed at the following readers.

Students who have completed, or are near to completion of, first degree courses in
computer, information science or applied mathematics, and plan to pursue a career in
information security. For them, this book may serve as an advanced course in applied
cryptography.

Security engineers in high-tech companies who are responsible for the design and
development of information security systems. If we say that the consequence of textbook

\x0ccrypto appearing in an academic research proposal may not be too harmful since the worst
case of the consequence would be an embarrassment, then the use of textbook crypto in an
information security product may lead to a serious loss. Therefore, knowing the unfitness of
textbook crypto for real world applications is necessary for these readers. Moreover, these
readers should have a good understanding of the security principles behind the fit-for-
application schemes and protocols and so they can apply the schemes and the principles
correctly. The self-contained mathematical foundations material in Part II makes the book a
suitable self-teaching text for these readers.
